    "# Using DSPy and MLflow with a local LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "DSPy (Declarative Self-improving Python) is an open-source framework that enables users to write Python code, rather than prompts, to build and direct LLMs. DSPy includes tools for directing the bahavior of LLMs, automatically optimize prompts and weights, and evaluate the performance of AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "MLflow's native integration with DSPy allows you to track and visualize the performance of your AI systems and to log your DSPy programs as MLflow models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use DSPy with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, running locally via LMStudio. Note that you can swap in any other model running on an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. We will use the DSPy to build a system for summarizing research papers from arXiv at different levels of complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when setting up a local inference server with LMStudio you will likely need to increase the `ctx_length` parameter and set the overflow policy to truncate middle, ensuring the system prompt with the instructions is retained. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will set up an MLflow experiment and enable DSPy autologging so we can easily view traces of all of our DSPy runs."

Integer columns in Python cannot represent missing values. If your input data contains missing values at inference time, it will be encoded as floats and will cause a schema enforcement error. The best way to avoid this problem is to infer the model schema based on a realistic data sample (training dataset) that includes missing values. Alternatively, you can declare integer columns as doubles (float64) whenever these columns may have missing values. See `Handling Integers With Missing Values <https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#handling-integers-with-missing-values>`_ for more details.\n",
